# Symfonos 3 Lab

Symfonos 3 is a penetration testing lab that belongs to the Symfonos series. It is designed to help learners practice penetration testing skills on a Linux server environment. This lab simulates real-world scenarios, allowing you to strengthen your abilities in information gathering, vulnerability exploitation, privilege escalation, and gaining full system control.  

## Objectives

- Understand and practice the steps of a penetration test.  
- Apply vulnerability exploitation techniques on a Linux system.  
- Improve skills in privilege escalation and obtaining root access.  

## Usage Guide

1. **Download the Symfonos 3 Virtual Machine**  

   Access the shared source to download the VM file.  
   [Download Symfonos 3 VM](https://1drv.ms/u/c/7440D728936C9568/AWiVbJMo10AggHQ0GQAAAAA?e=C6HKb3)

2. **Start the Virtual Machine**  

   Use VirtualBox or VMware to run the VM.  
   Set up your pentesting environment (Linux with pre-installed tools) on the same LAN network as the Symfonos 3 VM.  

3. **Begin the Pentest Process**  

   Use tools such as **nmap**, **gobuster**, **enum4linux**, and suitable exploitation techniques.
